## Objective: Optimizing Travel Agency Operations and Marketing Strategies

We are working with a Travel Agency that offers flight bookings for various airlines and seat classes. 
The travel agency wants to gain valuable insights from the booking data to optimize its operations and marketing strategies.

## Steps taken 

We have dataset of 1000 rows and 14 columns. The first step we did is to normalize this dataset so we can otain to eliminate redundant data, minimize data modification errors, and simplify the query process.
This is important step if new data comes in in the future, our database do not get any anomaly. Please refer to this document for more information: https://github.com/liyengL/sql_flight/blob/main/flight_normalization.md
